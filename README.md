# Malicious-AHK

This repo includes an installer that installs the actual proxexp.exe and several other things.
> 1. 2 Watchdogs
> 2. Keylogger
> 3. Installs in multiple directories


Anarchy.ahk will get rid of all of these things.


If you for some reason want to use this, I am not responsible for any of your actions you may have with this program. Also if you do want to use this, you also need to compile these scripts for this malware to actually work, if you are using it for experimental purposes then you can use the failsafe Anarchy.ahk (This needs to be compiled too)


If you do use this for a reason, you should change the googleform link to your own and add you own entry.[ints]= in SysInternal.ahk lines 34 and 38 I believe.
